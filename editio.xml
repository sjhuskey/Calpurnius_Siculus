                    <p>The seven eclogues of Calpurnius and the four of Nemesianus are preserved in
                        the same manuscripts, which is how it comes to pass that they are always
                        published together by scholars, even though they differ in terms of
                        refinement and charm. Add to this the fact that many who use inferior
                        manuscripts that attribute the eleven eclogues to Calpurnius alone say that
                        Nemesianus did not write any eclogues at all. From the time of [Taddeo]
                        Ugoleto there has been no shortage of those who divide the poems between
                        Calpurnius and Nemesianus, assigning the last four to the latter; until
                        recently they thought that Calpurnius had sent his poems to Nemesianus. But

                        that those eleven eclogues belong neither to one poet nor to the same
                        period, but rather that the first seven should be assigned to Calpurnius and
                        the rest to Nemesianus. He also demonstrated that Calpurnius lived under the
                        reign of Nero, while Nemesianus lived in the time of Carus and his sons.

                        Nevertheless, both because of the similarity in subject matter and the fact
                        that the condition of the text is the same in both poets’ eclogues, I prefer
                        to place Calpurnius side-by-side with Nemesianus.</p>

                    <head>II. Overview of the Tradition</head>
                    <p>There are three closely related families of manuscripts of Calpurnius and
                        Nemesianus, in particular all of those that trace their origin back to three
                        books copied from the same archetype. The first family includes two
                        manuscripts that should be considered the best witnesses of all, since they
                        are nearly free of interpolations, even though they rather frequently show
                        blemishes from the ignorance and carelessness of their copyists. Many
                        manuscripts conform to the so-called family <ref target="#V">V</ref>. Their
                        extraordinary agreement in many errors demonstrates that all of them emanate
                        from one book, which is also clear enough from the sheer abundance of
                        interpolations that are unique to this family. And yet, these manuscripts
                        are not corrupted in the same manner, but they can be divided into distinct
                        groups, which seems to me a tedious business and hardly worthwhile. Besides,
                                <bibl><author>Schenkl</author> (<title level="j">Wiener

                        edition) has distinguished two families, <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">w</hi>, but I wish he had not. It is easy for me to agree
                        with that most learned man concerning the group that is called <hi
                            rend="italic">w</hi>; but with regard to the manuscripts that he denotes
                        with the letter <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, it is impossible to know that all
                        of them are of the same kind when only a few readings have received full
                        scrutiny. But one manuscript is assigned to the third family because it
                        presents very many errors that the other manuscripts lack entirely.
                        Moreover, a good number of readings are found in it that are characteristic
                        of the better manuscripts, but it has none in common with the inferior
                        manuscripts. For this reason it occupies a kind of middle ground, so to
                        speak, between the books of good repute and those that have been corrupted.
                        Indeed, readings have been selected for these books from the German
                        manuscript of Thadeus Ugoletus and from the manuscript belonging to
                        Boccaccio, and various excerpts should be added, too. I will consider these
                        matters below.</p>

                    <p>Now I must discuss the manuscripts of the first family: <ref target="#N">N =

                        Family</ref>"). I will focus here on previous editors’ use of these
                        manuscripts before I provide a detailed comparison of the readings by the
                        manuscript hands.</p>
                    <p>Regarding <hi rend="bold">N</hi>, Jacques Philippe D’Orville was the first to
                        collate it carefully enough for Pieter Burmann’s use; his collation appears
                        in the <ref
                            target="https://books.google.be/books?id=fSIPAAAAQAAJ&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA723#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"
                            >appendix</ref> to <bibl><author>Burman’s</author>
                            <title corresp="#Burm">Poetae Latini Minores</title>
                            <biblScope unit="volume">Vol. 1</biblScope></bibl>. Next, Conrad Bursian
                        examined it on behalf of Moriz Haupt, but nothing is known about the quality
                        of his collation, since the edition promised by Haupt was never published.
                            <ref target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> was the next to use it, but in way
                        that rightly earned the scorn of Schenkl, who collated the manuscript in
                        1878 and inspected it again a few years later when preparing his <ref
                            target="#Schenkl2">second edition of Calpurnius and Nemesianus</ref>.
                        For my part, I examined the entire manuscript in 1907, but to remove all of
                        the discrepancies between my collation and the testimony of Schenkl, in the
                        summer of 1909 my friend Giampietro Zottoli inspected with me all of the
                        places where Schenkl had a different reading, and we often uncovered
                        carelessness on Schenkl’s part. I have published in my apparatus criticus
                        the entire collation of his manuscript, omitting not even the slightest
                        thing to do with orthography.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">G</hi> was mentioned by <ref target="#Glaeser">Glaeser</ref>
                        and <ref target="#Haupt">Haupt</ref>, but <ref target="#Baehr."
                            >Baehrens</ref> was the first to examine it, far too hurriedly; <ref
                            target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> was the next to use it, much more
                        carefully. I myself transcribed the manuscript in 1908 with as much
                        attentiveness as I could, but I collated it again in the following year, to
                        settle all of the discrepancies with <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref>.
                        Still, there are very many places that <ref target="Schenkl">Schenkl</ref>
                        has reported erroneously, as you can gather from my notes, for I have taken
                        greatest pains to publish all of the readings of this manuscript, too.</p>
                    <p>Having described the outer appearance of manuscripts N and G and explained
                        their provenance, I must now discuss in more detail their relationship and
                        their importance. Until now, no one except <ref target="#Baehr."
                            >Baehrens</ref> and <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> has examined
                        the authority of either manuscript. It is no wonder, since <ref
                            target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> was the first to collate the Gaddianus,
                        and no one before <ref target="#Glaeser">Glaeser</ref> considered the
                        Neapolitanus of much value. But <ref target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> and
                            <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> held different opinions: the
                        former, as usual, overvalues a manuscript that he was the first to publish
                        and argues that the Gaddianus is superior to the others; the latter,
                        however, prefers the Neapolitanus. But <ref target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref>
                        asserts his point of view instead of demonstrating it with strong evidence.
                        On the other hand, <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> tried to demonstrate
                        that the Gaddianus admitted interpolations in some places. It seems to me
                        that neither one has hit upon the truth entirely, as I think the following
                        makes clear.</p>
                    <p>I have already said that both manuscripts descend from the same archetype,
                        and that is supported by the very large number of readings that N has in
                        common with G, when something else is written in the rest of the
                        manuscripts. But, to be fair, they differ among themselves in many places,
                        and it is right to discuss their differences so that it will be easier to
                        see which manuscript departs less from the archetype. In doing this, I take
                        no account of readings that are attributed to the second or third hand in
                        the Neapolitanus or of the various readings that the copyist added in the
                        margin of the Gaddianus. I shall consider those later.</p>
                    <p>But first of all, although the repute of each of the two manuscripts is
                        frequently distorted because of the carelessness and ignorance of the
                        copyists, it seems to me that the Gaddianus was copied a little more
                        carelessly. For instance, four verses (Calp. 1.40, 4.16, 4.123; Nemes. 1.73)
                        are missing from it, and Nemesianus 2.49 has been placed after verse 45:
                        Moreover, the following words have been omitted: Calp. 1.92 <quote
                            xml:lang="la">ipsa</quote>, 2.88 <quote xml:lang="la">quotiens</quote>,
                        3.23 <quote xml:lang="la">deus</quote>, 3.3 <quote xml:lang="la"
                        >sed</quote>, 3.89 <quote xml:lang="la">non</quote>. But in the Neapolitan
                        manuscript, no verse is missing (it is unnecessary, I think, for me to
                        remind you that I speak here about the unique defects of each manuscript,
                        not about the common defects that are rightly assigned to the archetype),
                        but Calp. 1.31–32 have been inverted, and Nemes. 2.81 was inserted after
                        3.16. Then the copyist overlooked the following words: Calp. 6.46 <quote
                            xml:lang="la">pignus</quote>, 6.90 <quote xml:lang="la">hoc</quote>,
                        Nemes. 1.23 <quote xml:lang="la">et</quote>, 1.71 <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >et</quote>, 3.5 <quote xml:lang="la">ex tereti</quote>, 4.60 <quote
                            xml:lang="la">audit</quote>. Add to this the fact that in almost 130
                        places N offers the correct reading and G an erroneous one and the opposite
                        happens a little less frequently.</p>
                    <p>Each of the two manuscripts has some errors (N has more by far) in common
                        with V, which could not have happened in every case entirely by chance. The
                        following places are clearly due to interpolation: Calp. 2.73 <quote

                        without doubt glosses inserted later in place of the poets’ words. One could
                        say the same thing about <quote xml:lang="la">accipiet</quote>, <quote
                            xml:lang="la">ethera</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">discedere</quote>.
                        Also <quote xml:lang="la">aethera</quote> and <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >discedere</quote> are just as good as <quote xml:lang="la">aera</quote>
                        and <quote xml:lang="la">descendere</quote>, and for a long time I was not
                        sure which of the two I preferred. And <quote xml:lang="la">liquide</quote>,
                            <quote xml:lang="la">primum</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la"
                        >flavit</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">carmina</quote> (Nemes. I 16) should
                        not be considered interpolations, but rather corruptions that arose in these
                        places since the words that should have been written by the copyist appeared
                        nearby. Thus, <quote xml:lang="la">liquide</quote> is derived from <quote
                            xml:lang="la">dulce</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">primum</quote> from
                            <quote xml:lang="la">spatium</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >flavit</quote> from <quote xml:lang="la">inflare</quote>, <quote
                            xml:lang="la">carmina</quote> from <quote xml:lang="la">carmine</quote>.
                        But <quote xml:lang="la">carmina</quote> (Nemes. 1.63) is either a gloss or
                        a corruption that owes its origin from the initial sound of the next word,
                        and <quote xml:lang="la">corpore</quote> and <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >robore</quote> are very often confused in the manuscripts. Then there
                        are these words: <quote xml:lang="la">herus</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >raris</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">omnes</quote>. One would hardly
                        believe that they were made by an interpolator since they are meaningless.
                        But for the most part, the rest of the examples can be attributed to an
                        interpolator. The following places in N should be considered: Calp. 1.13
                            <quote xml:lang="la">sequar</quote>, 4.46 <quote xml:lang="la">inter
                            nostras</quote>, 4.136 <quote xml:lang="la">pede velox</quote>, 4.153
                            <quote xml:lang="la">in</quote>, 4.164 <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >vestros</quote>, Nemes. 2.71 <quote xml:lang="la">ducas</quote>. <quote
                            xml:lang="la">in</quote> is a gloss. <quote xml:lang="la">ducas</quote>
                        is closer to <quote xml:lang="la">ducam</quote>, which the inferior
                        manuscripts have, than to <quote xml:lang="la">duco</quote>, which G
                        correctly offers. <quote xml:lang="la">vestros</quote> is owed to an
                        interpolator. The rest are uncertain.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the writings of both manuscripts have been corrupted in various
                        ways, but sometimes they betray an infelicitous effort at emendation. I
                        would like you to consider the following places, for it is not necessary to
                        say anything about the rest): Calp. 1.90 <quote xml:lang="la">querit</quote>
                        N, <quote xml:lang="la">petit</quote> G; 2.96 <quote xml:lang="la">o</quote>
                        G; 3.50 <quote xml:lang="la">turbidus</quote> G; 4.63 <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >carmen modulavit</quote> G; 4.125 <quote xml:lang="la">placanda</quote>
                        G; 5.15 <quote xml:lang="la">montibus</quote> G; 5.16 <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >cecinere</quote> G; 5.104 <quote xml:lang="la">nectendum</quote> N,
                            <quote xml:lang="la">videndum</quote> G; Nemes. 2.30 <quote
                            xml:lang="la">nullo sudarunt</quote> G, 4.28 <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >volucrum tum</quote> G; 4.39 <quote xml:lang="la">subeunte</quote> G.
                        Indeed it is hardly the case that all of these places are equally
                        suspicious, for <quote xml:lang="la">o</quote> is a gloss, and I do not
                        think one should think otherwise about <quote xml:lang="la">carmen
                            modulavit</quote>. But <quote xml:lang="la">turbidus</quote> is clearly
                        an interpolation, which I could hardly say about <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >volucrum tum</quote>. Then <quote xml:lang="la">querit</quote> and
                            <quote xml:lang="la">petit</quote> perhaps stem from a poorly understood
                        abbreviation of the word <quote xml:lang="la">quatit</quote>, but that gives
                        me pause. But the other examples, with due respect to <ref target="#Schenkl"
                            >Schenkl</ref>, are hardly attributable to interpolators, unless you
                        happen to think that those interpolators were completely ignorant of the
                        Latin language.</p>
                    <p>But before we pass judgment on the authority of manuscripts N and G, we must
                        say a few things about the corrections that each manuscript underwent.</p>
                    <p xml:id="Ndesc-firsthand">Manuscript N, <ref target="#CodexNeapolitanusTrans"
                            >as we said above</ref>, was emended rather often by the original
                        copyist and others. But all of the emendations of the first hand, which I
                        have detected in almost sixty places, arose from the archetype itself. The
                        copyist, as often happens, sometimes corrected the more trivial scribal
                        errors as he wrote; we are all used to making these errors when we write.
                        Accordingly, he added letters that he omitted by writing too quickly, or he
                        deleted extra letters, or he changed vowels and consonants, or he added
                        words that had been omitted, or he restored the order of verses, or he
                        inserted notes about people. Since that is the case, nearly all of the
                        emendations by the first hand are good, or, to state it more truthfully,
                        they restore the wording of the archetype. At Calp. 1.20, the first hand
                        corrected <quote xml:lang="la">dipicta</quote> to <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >depicta</quote>, which <ref target="#Jacoby">Jacoby</ref> recently
                        defended in vain, since <quote xml:lang="la">descripta</quote> is to be read
                        without doubt (cfr. Verg. Ecl. 5.13 and Calp. 1.25), but <quote
                            xml:lang="la">depicta</quote> was in the archetype, as G shows us.
                        Similarly at Nemes. 4.65 <quote xml:lang="la">aversa</quote> is wrong (cfr.
                        Verg. Ecl. 8.101 sq.), and the first hand has changed the fault into <quote
                            xml:lang="la">adversa</quote>, but <quote xml:lang="la">adversa</quote>
                        is found in G, from which you can easily conclude that the same reading
                        appeared in the archetype. Only once did the first hand corrupt the true
                        reading of the archetype (Calp. 3.67 <quote xml:lang="la">qui</quote> from
                            <quote xml:lang="la">quam</quote>), but that should be attributed to an
                        abbreviation, not at all to his intellect. Finally, all of the corrections
                        of the first hand are confirmed by the readings in manuscript G, with the
                        exception of Calp. 1.24 <quote xml:lang="la">propius</quote>, where I have
                        reasonable suspicion that the person who wrote G misread the word.</p>
                    <p xml:id="Ndesc-secondhand">The second hand’s so-called emendations are three
                        times as frequent as the first hand’s, but in terms of proportion, they are
                        found much more often in Calpurnius than in Nemesianus, and around a third
                        of them are correct. For the most part, the second hand corrects scribal
                        errors of a more trivial sort, but sometimes it restores omitted verses or
                        errors, or it corrects transposed verses, or it completely overhauls more
                        serious problems. In general, the second hand’s emendations come from
                        manuscripts of the second family, not the archetype, but an interpolator has
                        corrected some of them after his own fashion. It does not take many examples
                        to demonstrate this, but, to begin with passages successfully restored,
                        consider these readings with me, dear reader:</p>

                        proof, reflect on these other examples. First of all, in following places
                        the second hand of manuscript N substituted the interpolations that mar the

                    <p>And so if the second hand’s emendations agree with manuscripts of family V,
                        they can add no authority to them, since they arose from them; but if they
                        depend on no other manuscript, they must be considered to be the conjectures
                        of a fairly learned person. If we have discussed them correctly, the
                        emendations of that sort are entirely without merit, and I did not unjustly
                        omit them outright when I compared manuscript N with G.</p>

                        the more trivial scribal errors. All of the corrections are good, and they
                        are derived from the archetype itself (as agreement with its twin manuscript
                        shows), with only three exceptions: Nemes. 2.73, 3.63, 4.10, which the
                        scribe unsucessfully tried to emend. Nemes. 3.53 does not count, since in
                        this passage either the copyist of manuscript N could read poorly, or G
                        entered a correction made either above the line or in the margin of the
                        archetype. But aside from these emendations I found nearly alternate
                        readings in the margin of this manuscript, which most often were added by
                        the copyist himself. All are derived either from some manuscript of no
                        special repute or from the conjecture of some scholar. For the most part,
                        they are not even worthy of mention.</p>
                    <p>If I have done my job, it is clear what we should think about each of these
                        manuscripts. Manuscripts N and G outstrip the others not only in the good
                        quality of their archetype, but also because their copyists were content to
                        transcribe the archetype faithfully, and they generally abstained from
                        interpolating the words of the poets. For very rarely have the words handed
                        down from antiquity been corrupted by the judgment of the scribes. That is
                        why this is the biggest difference between the Neapolitanus and the
                        Gaddianus: that the latter generally put the reading of the archetype to the
                        test by his own devices, but the former admitted the interpolations of
                        inferior manuscripts. And, if we want to think clearly, the Neapolitanus
                        should be preferred in a certain way, but not as Schenkl wanted. For the
                        Gaddianus has nearly the same number of good readings as the Neapolitanus,
                        and sometimes it alone out of all of the manuscripts preserves the genuine
                        reading for us. And so, there is need for both manuscripts in representing
                        the true picture of the archetype.</p>

                            perpetuated the mistake. Calpurnius’ bucolic poetry includes such a
                            large number of corrections and glosses added by various hands either in
                            the verses themselves or in the margin that the various hands cannot
                            always be distinguished among themselves. But that is as much as I will
                            say, since I propose to discuss the annotations of <ref

                    </list>
                    <p>I have added three other manuscripts, namely Gothanus 55 (= <ref target="θ"

                            rend="bold">δ</ref>), but I have not inspected them personally.</p>
                    <p xml:id="CodGothanus55">The description of the codex Gothanus <ref target="θ"
                            >below</ref> is derived from <ref target="Wernsdorf">Wernsdorf’s</ref>
                        description. I. G. Meusel collated the manuscript for Wernsdorf. The
                        descriptions of <ref target="η" rend="bold">η</ref> and <ref target="δ"
                            rend="bold">δ</ref> are derived from the descriptions in <ref

                    <p>All of the manuscripts that I have assigned to the second family were copied
                        from one book, which I will call <ref target="#V">V</ref>, or from a copy of
                        it. The common origin of these manuscripts is attested not only by the
                        omission or transposition of the same verses and words, but also by the
                        great number of interpolations and errors that the other manuscripts lack
                        entirely. But aside from these common faults, which were transmitted from
                        the archetype, the individual manuscripts have many other errors unique to
                        themselves. These books can be assigned to specific groups through careful
                        comparison. For that reason, I do not want to linger on this subject, but I
                        will advise that Riccadianus 724 and Vaticanus Reginensis 1759 are so
                        similar to each other that you would rightly come to the following
                        conclusions: that they were copied from the same book; that the
                        Ottobonianus, Laurentianus pl. 37,14, the first Rehdigeranus (I.4.10), the
                        Gothanus, and the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> descended from the
                        same copy of manuscript <ref target="#V">V</ref> on account of certain
                        evidence; and finally that Vaticanus Urbinas 353 and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >editio Veneta</hi> in 1472 are closely related by the tightest bonds of
                        affinity. For the oldest editions are rightly thought to be reproductions of
                        manuscripts (cfr. <ref target="#Sabbadini">Sabbadini</ref>, p. 213 n. 5);
                        moreover, the <hi rend="italic">editio Veneta</hi> was printed before
                        Fridericus de Veteranis transcribed the Codex Urbinas (cfr. <ref
                            target="#Curcio">Curcio</ref>, p. VIII). Finally, I add that I found the
                        oldest edition of Calpurnius and Nemesianus in the Bibliotheca Riccardiana,
                        recorded by no editor until now, place and year of publication unknown,
                        currently bearing the number 498, which I can demonstrate by the strongest
                        of arguments was copied from the manuscript Laurentianus pl. 37,14 before
                        that manuscript underwent the corrections of the so-called second hand.</p>
                    <p>If any one should collate all of the manuscripts of this family with care, he
                        would easily know which readings are those of the archetype from which all
                        of them originate, and which are owed to the copyists of the individual
                        manuscripts. And so now it remains to compare <ref target="#V">V</ref> with
                            <ref target="#N">N</ref> and <ref target="#G">G</ref> and to see what
                        authority should be attributed to them.</p>
                    <p>First of all, both families, but more often <ref target="#V">V</ref>, are
                        marred with gaps in verses and words. Eleven verses are missing in <ref
                            target="#V">V</ref> (Calp. 1.51, 7.32–34, 7.52–54, Nemes. 1.29, 2.83,
                        3.25, 3.30) and one verse has been made from the two verses Calp. 2.18–19.
                        On the other hand, Calp. 1.42 is missing in <ref target="#N">N</ref> and
                            <ref target="#G">G</ref>, and the following words have been omitted:
                        Calp. 4.94 <quote xml:lang="la">posito</quote>, 7.71 <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >et</quote>, Nemes. 3.6 <quote xml:lang="la">hanc pueri tamquam</quote>.
                        Moreover, in <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                        <ref target="G">G</ref> Calpurnius 5.7 is placed before 5.6 and in <ref
                            target="#V">V</ref> Calpurnius 5.67 is placed before 5.66. But since
                        verses and supplied words have been passed down from antiquity and cannot be
                        attributed to interpolators, the carelessness of copyists must not be blamed
                        in these passages. But with regard to the words <quote xml:lang="la">(h)anc
                            pueri tamquam</quote>, which were omitted in <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                        <ref target="#G">G</ref> even though there was space for them, the copyist,
                        in my opinion, deliberately omitted them because he did not understand the
                        writing in the archetype.</p>
                    <p><ref target="#N">N</ref>
                        <ref target="#G">G</ref> and <ref target="#V">V</ref> differ in two hundred
                        places or even more, but the readings correctly preserved in <ref
                            target="#N">N</ref>
                        <ref target="#G">G</ref> are almost two times greater than those in the
                        second family. Moreover, what is even more interesting, nearly all of the
                        corruptions that blemish <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                        <ref target="#G">G</ref> are owed to the carelessness or ignorance of their
                        copyists, but <ref target="#V">V</ref> quite often underwent interpolations.
                        For example, there is no doubt that in <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                        <ref target="#G">G</ref> the following passages drew their flaws from either
                        the carelessness of a copyist or an abbreviation poorly understood: Calp.

                    <p>Glosses have been received into the text in the following passages: Calp. 1.5
                            <quote xml:lang="la">molliter</quote>, Nemes. 1.49 <quote xml:lang="la"

                            xml:lang="la">uvas</quote>. Also, <quote xml:lang="la">litora</quote>
                        Nem. 2.22 comes from the same word placed at the beginning of the verse, and
                            <quote xml:lang="la">visus</quote> Calp. 7.84 comes from the preceding
                        verse. There are certainly some passages that you could trace back to an
                        interpolator: Calp. 1.20 <quote xml:lang="la">depicta</quote>, 1.24 <quote

                            <quote xml:lang="la">subeunt(e)</quote>, but, from the perspective of
                        the archetype, I would attribute even these passages, with one or two
                        exceptions, to the ignorance or carelessness of a copyist.</p>
                    <p>The same cannot be said about the archetype of the second family; indeed,
                        things could not be more different. To say nothing of glosses received into
                        the text, or words moved either because of the scribes’ mistake or judgment
                        (cfr. Calp. 1.8–9, 2.4, 2.73, 3.74, 3.88, 4.76, 4.83, 7.83, Nemes. 1.72,
                        2.1, 2.23, 2.33, 2.40, 2.47, 2.76, 4.54), and other faults that you could
                        explain in various ways, I have detected the following in particular in it,
                        and it detracts greatly from its authority. I refer to a great abundance of
                        interpolations that have arisen only out of a passion for making changes.
                        And, just to dismiss the several passages that others have ascribed to the
                        carelessness of copyists, there is no reason to doubt that the readings
                        marshalled here are owed to an interpolator: Calp. 1.45 <quote xml:lang="la"

                            target="#P">below</ref> is derived from F. Buecheler’s edition of
                        Petronius (Berlin 1862, p. XXf.). Regarding this manuscript or one very
                        similar to it, Poggio wrote the following to Niccolò de’ Niccoli (Epist.
                        1.91) in 1423: <quote>mittas ad me oro Bucolicam Calpurnii et particulam

                            >Pithou</ref> was the first to use this manuscript, then <ref

                            >Haupt</ref>), and <ref target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> collated it.

                        inspected many of its passages.</p>
                    <p>The copyist who wrote the Codex Parisinus was utterly ignorant of the Latin
                        language. In his completely careless performance of his task he committed
                        countless scribal errors, and he did not finish his work, since the
                        manuscript contains the first three eclogues by Calpurnius and stops in
                        mid-sentence at verse 12 of the fourth. Since I have mentioned all of the
                        readings of this manuscript in my apparatus criticus, there is no need to
                        report here all of the defects of writing with which it teems. But I will
                        now recount certain rather curious things that are unique to this
                        manuscript, so that you will be all the more amazed at the copyist’s
                        carelessness and ignorance:</p>

                    <p>But despite such an abundance of errors, sometimes the Codex Parisinus
                        reports a correct reading of the archetype that has been corrupted in the
                        other two families: cfr. 2.14 <quote xml:lang="la">naides</quote> P, <quote

                            >paliribus</quote> N G, <quote xml:lang="la">palilibus</quote> V. To
                        those passage you could add 1.4 <quote xml:lang="la">ornyte</quote>*, <quote
                            xml:lang="la">ornyce</quote> P, <quote xml:lang="la">ornite</quote> N G

                        conjecture, nevertheless you would hardly think that a copyist whose
                        ignorance and carelessness we have detected in so many and such great
                        passages should be pardoned. If we have discussed these matters properly,
                        all of the interpolations that the manuscript underwent are owed to the
                        archetype, but the numerous mistakes in writing must be attributed to the
                        copyist.</p>
                    <p>But to make a better judgment about the worth of this manuscript, we should
                        consider what its readings are in the passages where the first family
                        differs from the second.</p>
                    <p>First of all, N G P often give a good reading where V has a corrupt one:</p>

                    <p>In conclusion, to review what has been accomplished in this discussion, where
                        N and G agree with P, there is no doubt that their reading should be
                        preferred to readings of the second family. We have seen that this rule is
                        violated in only three places (1.48 <quote xml:lang="la">victas</quote>,
                        2.14 <quote xml:lang="la">affuerant</quote>, 3.73 <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >vi</quote>), with which I do not concern myself. But where N and G
                        differ from P and V, both groups of manuscripts have nearly the same number
                        of good and corrupt readings. But far be it from me to give equal authority
                        to both groups, for nearly all of the corruptions that N and G received, as
                        it were, by inheritance from the archetype of the first family are owed to
                        the carelessness or ignorance of copyists, but the faults of other
                        manuscripts should be attributed to the perverse zeal of pseudo-scholars for
                        emending and interpolating. That is why, with one or two exceptions, there
                        is never any uncertainty about which reading to select. If these matters
                        have been established correctly, then the Codex Parisinus cannot always be
                        accepted as an arbiter, but we ought always to consider its readings and we
                        must also be sad that it has such a brief run of verses.</p>

                            <quote>This manuscript was collated with greatest care with the very old
                            manuscript that Taddeo Ugoleto, librarian of the royal library in
                            Hungary, brought from Germany. Also with the one that Giovanni Boccaccio
                            is said to have written with his own hand to dedicate to the library of
                            Santo Spirito in Florence: We found the title and division of the work
                            in that manuscript, along with many poems.</quote></p>
                    <p>Codex Riccardianus 636 is written very beautifully on the leaves that contain
                        the bucolic poetry of Calpurnius and Nemesianus, but at a later date various
                        hands have obscured the transmitted text by erasing or emending to such a
                        degree that sometimes you can barely see what the original reading was.
                        Moreover, because of their similarities, I could not, like Schenkl, always
                        distinguish the later hands. That is why I have indicated all of them,
                        except Angeli’s readings, in the apparatus criticus with the symbol <ref
                            target="#ρ2">ρ²</ref>. For the hand of Angeli is easily distinguished
                        from the others in nearly all instances. And now we must consider his
                        readings to make a proper judgment about the authority of the Codex
                        Germanicus, since we learn nothing from the edition published in Parma
                        (around 1500) or the first Florentine edition (1504), even though Angeli
                        edited the latter and Angelo Ugoleto added at the end of the former that he
                        had established the text based on the Codex Germanicus, when both editions,
                        as Schenkl has demonstrated conclusively, derived from Codex Riccardianus
                        636.</p>
                    <p>First to consider is whether all of the readings noted by Angeli were taken
                        from the Codex Germanicus or had some other origin. In the subcription of
                        the Codex Riccardianus <ref target="#Riccardianus636SubTrans">that we
                            reported above</ref> there is mention of many other manuscripts.
                        Moreover, Angeli’s annotations can be divided generally into two classes,
                        for most of them agree with N G, and the rest with certain manuscripts of
                        the second family, especially Codex Urbinas 353 Vatican 3152, Ambrosianus
                        O.74 sup., and the edition published in Venice in 1472. Consider the

                        7.18 <quote xml:lang="la">spectavimus</quote> Aκχ. In light of these facts,
                        it seems very close to the truth that the Codex Germanicus derived from the
                        same archetype as N and G, and that the readings that agree with N and G
                        should be attributed to that archetype, but that Angeli copied the rest of
                        the readings from interpolated manuscripts. This inference is supported by
                        the fact that Angeli discloses in the subscription to the Codex Riccardianus
                        that he used other manuscripts, too. This agrees with the fact that the four
                        later poems were attributed to Nemesianus in the Codex Germanicus, as
                        attested by Niccolò Angeli at the end of Calpurnius in the Codex
                        Riccardianus and Angelo Ugoleto at the end of the original from Parma. N and
                        G divide the eleven eclogues between Calpurnius and Nemesianus in the same
                        way, but all of them are attributed to Calpurnius alone in the manuscripts
                        of the second family. Therefore the Codex Germanicus should certainly be
                        assigned to the first family. But could it not happen that the Codex
                        Germanicus underwent some interpolations? Indeed it could have happened, but
                        since the task of seeking out a semblance of the lost manuscript is a very
                        risky venture, even though the inference seems probable to me, I
                        nevertheless prefer to report all of Angeli’s readings without distinction
                        under the symbol <ref target="#A">A</ref>. And I feel so strongly about the
                        authority of the Codex Germanicus that when it agrees with N or G, it offers
                        us another witness to the first family, and when it agrees with V, it has
                        the same force as a manuscript of the second family. For Angeli’s
                        annotations hardly ever differ from all of the manuscripts: Calp. 1.45
                            <quote xml:lang="la">in ulnis</quote>, 1.86 <quote xml:lang="la"

                        5.79 <quote xml:lang="la">et vitrosa</quote>, 5.104 <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >hic</quote>, 7.59 <quote xml:lang="la">manticoram</quote>, Nemes. 1.70

                            >horti</quote>, 2.83 <quote xml:lang="la">qui</quote>. But sometimes the
                        Codex Germanicus alone among all manuscripts preserves for us the true
                        reading or traces of the true reading, as at Calp. 2.3 <quote xml:lang="la"
                            >nec et</quote>, 5.65 <quote xml:lang="la">tinniat ore</quote>. Finally,
                        in the same Codex Riccardianus there are certain corrections that cannot be
                        attributed to Angeli, but doubtlessly descend from some manuscript of the
                        first family. Perhaps some corrector copied those, too, from the Codex
                        Germanicus.</p>
                    <p xml:id="Boccaccio">Regarding Boccaccio’s manuscript, truly the things that
                        can be said are few and uncertain. For although the Codex Harleianus,
                        according to its subscription, was collated with the Codex Germanicus,
                        Boccaccio’s manuscript, and many others, for the most part the readings that
                        Angelius did not note in the Codex Riccardianus seem to go back to
                        Boccaccio’s manuscript. After carefully inspecting these readings, we can
                        conclude only this: that the manuscrupt that Boccaccio is said to have
                        written with his own hand must be assigned to the so-called first family.
                        Everything else is highly uncertain. As for the authority of this
                        manuscript, the same things that I said about the Codex Germanicus apply.
                        Finally, I think we should not overlook that in one place (Nemes. 4.70
                            <quote xml:lang="la">quo</quote> Boccaccio’s manuscript alone, out of
                        all of the manuscripts, displays the true reading.</p>

                            poets, have also some verses selected from Calpurnius’ eclogues 2, 3, 4,
                            5, 6 and a few others from Nemesianus’ fourth eclogue, attributed there
                            to Calpurnius. For in the Codex Thuaneus at the beginning of the first
                            excerpt the following is inscribed: <quote xml:lang="la">Calpurnius in
                                bucolicis</quote>; in the Codex Nostradamensis: <quote xml:lang="la"
                                >Scalpurius in bucolicis</quote>. But in the latter, the corruption
                            of the name traces its origin to the initial letter of the first verse:
                                <quote xml:lang="la">Satis hoc</quote> (2.23). These are the

                            manuscripts that we have today must be traced back by various paths to
                            the same archetype, as their many errors in common indicate, especially
                            the lacuna and the confusion of verses in the amoebaean song in
                            Calpurnius’ fourth eclogue. But that the excerpts about which we speak
                            cannot trace their origin further is supported by a single, but very
                            strong argument (cf. <bibl><author>H. Schenkl</author>, <title level="j"

                            kindly pointed out many things while I was establishing the text of
                            Calpurnius and Nemesianus. But so that no one attributes to them the
                            errors that I have fallen into, I declare that I have noted everything
                            that they shared with me in its own place in the appratus criticus.</p>

                                            of Calfurnius to Nemesianus of Carthage</quote>).
                                        Nemesianus follows Calpurnius with the following title
                                        prefixed: <quote xml:lang="la">Aureliani nemesiani
                                            cartaginiensis egloghe incipiunt</quote> (<quote>Here
                                            begin the eclogues of Aurelianus Nemesianus of
                                            Carthage</quote>). At the end of each eclogue there
                                        appears an <hi rend="italic">explicit</hi> with the number
                                        of each eclogue, but Calpurnius’ sixth eclogue lacks a
                                        subscription, and the following is written at the end of the
                                        seventh: <quote xml:lang="la">explicit sexta egloga
                                            Calphurnii</quote> (<quote>Here ends the sixth eclogue
                                            of Calphurnius</quote>). This is explained by the fact
                                        that the seventh eclogue follows the sixth without any
                                        break, with the result that only six eclogues are attributed
                                        to Calpurnius in this manuscript. But in the margin, where
                                        the sixth eclogue ought to end, the copyist has added the
                                        following: <quote xml:lang="la">aliqui volunt dicere quod
